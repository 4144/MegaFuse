Q: Is this a sync application?
A: No.
   Traditionally on linux the filesystem and the sync tool are separate programs.
   MegaFuse allows you to access the remote filesystem, then you can use most of the sync apps that are already available on your linux distribution to sync any folder you want.

Q: Why there is no GUI?
A: Operations performed through mega are done synchronously. It's the operating system itself that alerts you about the result of an operation.
   For example, if you copy a file to the MEGA folder, the copy operation completes when the file has been successfully uploaded.
   Of course a GUI can be added but it would be an additional application written on top of MegaFuse.

Q: Why it is so fast?
A: A cache is kept to speed up operations. Files are split in chunks during the download, reads can be completed as soon as enough data is available.

Q: How do I open a media file for streaming? Can I jump to a specific point of the file?
A: The downloader is smart enough to assign a higher priority to the requested portion of the file.
   Just open the audio/video file with your favourite player. I suggest VLC.
   You can do all the operations supported by your player as if the file was saved on your hard drive.

Q: How do I access a shared file from another account?
A: Import the file into your account, then it will be available from MegaFuse
